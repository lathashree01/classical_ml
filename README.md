## Usage of the repository
Each algorithm is implemented from scratch in jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations (where possible). Some visualisations are also included to help understand the concepts better. You can run the notebooks directly in your browser using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

## Installation

To install jupyter notebook, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install 
```
To run the jupyter notebook, use the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or Install Jupyter Lab (Optional)
Jupyter Lab provides an improved interface over Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```
To run Jupyter Lab, use the following command:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
